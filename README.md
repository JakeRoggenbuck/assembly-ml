# assembly-ml

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning library for Python written in x86-64 Assembly.

## Roadmap

This project has been broken down into multiple parts.

#### 1. add_one
Part 1. is the folder called `add_one` which is a C extension for Python that adds a very simple function in C that is accessible in Python.

#### 2. linear-regression
Part 2. is the `linear-regression` folder which is linear regression written in C.

#### 3. TODO
Part 3. will be to add the regression code to another C extension to be able to use linear regression Python that was implemented in C

#### 4. TODO
Part 4. will be to convert the linear regression code into x86-64 assembly

#### 5. TODO
Part 5. will be to write the C extension code in x86-64 assembly and add the linear regression assembly
